        <h1>Our Logo</h1>
        <p>
          The logo — unveiled in fall 1995 — helped usher in a new era for the
          organization, which had previously been known as the Human Rights
          Campaign Fund.

        <p>
          The Human Rights Campaign logo is one of the most recognizable symbols
          of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community. It has
          become synonymous with the fight for equal rights for LGBTQ+
          Americans.
        </p>
        <p>
          The logo — unveiled in fall 1995 — helped usher in a new era for the
          organization, which had previously been known as the Human Rights
          Campaign Fund. When HRCF was founded in 1980, it was primarily a fund
          for supporting pro-fairness congressional candidates. The rebranding
          in 1995 announced to the country that, in the words of then- Executive
          Director Elizabeth Birch, "We're so much more than a fund."
        </p>
        <p>
          The logo was the final touch on a complete reorganization of HRC. In
          addition to the well-established lobbying and political action
          committee capabilities, new Foundation programs — including the
          Workplace Project and Family Project — were added. All of HRC's
          research, communications, marketing and public relations functions
          were broadly expanded. HRC began a long period of robust growth and
          became respected as one of the largest and most effective mainstream
          advocacy organizations in the country. As Birch would often say, "A
          logo is only as meaningful as the hard work and standard of excellence
          it represents."
        </p>
        <p>
          The new name and logo reflected the wider goals and influence of the
          organization, which grew in strength to now spread the message of
          equality to every corner of the country.
        </p>
        <p>
          The genesis of the HRC logo began with Birch's vision for a unifying
          message for the organization. Birch formed a committee that included
          current and former HRC senior staff such as Cathy Nelson and David
          Smith and board members and marketing talents such as Lisa Sherman,
          Wes Combs and Bob Witeck. She also enlisted the help of marketing and
          design firm Stone Yamashita. Birch had worked with Keith Yamashita
          while at Apple Computer and admired Robert Stone's clean and exciting
          design style. Susan Schuman, also from Apple, joined Birch at HRC and
          helped guide the new positioning and branding efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stone Yamashita created 10 potential designs for the logo, some of
          which were variations on the old torch logo. Birch was drawn to one
          depicting a yellow equal sign inside of a blue square. Though it was
          the second-favorite choice among focus groups, Birch and her committee
          insisted on the simple, bold design.
        </p>
        <p>
          After four months of work to reinvent the organization's branding, the
          logo was introduced with new HRC letterhead, business cards and a
          campaign T-shirt. (The shirt is still sold in HRC Shops and on
          <a href="#">shop.hrc.org.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          The logo started popping up everywhere. In doing research for a
          bumper-sticker purchase order, staff member Don Kiser, now HRC's
          creative director, learned that a square logo — different from the
          traditional rectangular bumper sticker — would cost just pennies to
          produce. The logo sticker was — and still is — distributed to new and
          prospective members who, in turn, help draw attention to HRC's work by
          placing the sticker on their cars and windows.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before long, the HRC logo was as visible at pride celebrations and
          other LGBTQ+ events as the iconic rainbow flag. Today, the HRC logo
          can be spotted the world over, from cars in Japan to the backpacks of
          hikers in Tibet.

        <p>
          In late March 2013, as the U.S. Supreme Court was hearing arguments in
          two marriage equality cases, HRC shared a red version of its logo –
          selected because the color is synonymous with love - on Facebook and
          Twitter and asked supporters to change their profile photos to show
          their support. The campaign went viral, and celebrities such as George
          Takei, Beyonce, Martha Stewart and others helped draw attention to the
          movement. Millions of people shared the logo, countless memes were
          created in response, and Facebook saw a
          <a href="#">120 percent increase</a> in profile photo updates. The
          Internet was awash in red and displayed the growing support for
          marriage equality in the U.S. and the world. Today, the red HRC logo
          continues to be used by HRC to promote LGBTQ+ rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          The campaign put the spotlight on HRC and spread awareness about the
          organization and its original blue and yellow logo. Whether the logo
          is seen on a T-shirt, an HRC publication, a lawmaker's lapel or as a
          backdrop for a historic speech by the president of the United States,
          it sends a message that the Human Rights Campaign and its more than 3
          million members and supporters will remain vigilant in the fight for
          LGBTQ+ equality.
